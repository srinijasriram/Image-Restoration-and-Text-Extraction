# Image-Restoration-and-Text-Extraction
In the digital age, the preservation and accessibility of textual information from historical documents, archival materials, and degraded text images are of paramount importance. However, over time, these documents may undergo degradation, leading to challenges in readability and interpretation. To address these issues, advanced image processing techniques and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology have emerged as powerful tools for enhancing text image quality and extracting textual content. In this paper, we present a comprehensive approach aimed at restoring degraded text images and extracting textual content with high precision and efficiency. Our methodology combines adaptive image restoration techniques with OCR technology to overcome the limitations posed by noise, blur, and other forms of degradation, thereby enabling accurate and reliable extraction of textual information from degraded text images.

The primary objective of this project is to develop an integrated solution for restoring degraded text images and extracting textual content with enhanced accuracy and efficiency. Leveraging the AdaptiveFastNlMeansDenoisingColored algorithm for image restoration and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology for text extraction, the project aims to address the limitations of existing methods and innovate in the restoration process. The key innovation lies in the adaptive adjustment of restoration parameters based on local image characteristics, optimizing restoration performance and improving image quality. By focusing on enhancing the restoration process, the project aims to achieve superior restoration quality, ultimately leading to more accurate text extraction results.

Furthermore, the project aims to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed solution through rigorous evaluation using objective metrics such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). These metrics serve as quantitative measures of image quality, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of the restoration process. By comparing PSNR and SSIM values before and after restoration, the project seeks to demonstrate the improvement in image quality achieved through the innovative restoration approach. Additionally, the accuracy of text extraction using OCR will be evaluated to assess the practical utility of the restored images for information retrieval and analysis purposes. Overall, the project aims to advance the state-of-the-art in image restoration and text extraction, contributing to the broader goals of digitization, preservation, and accessibility of textual information from degraded text images.
